LitUIKit is a collection of Flutter widgets to create unique user interfaces. It complements the default Material Widgets shipped with Flutter. Whose Widgets include custom implementation of Snackbars,
AppBars and a settings panel. Utility Screens (e.g. required to verify the user's age and to show the
application's licenses) are also included.

Visit our [website](https://litlifesoftware.github.io) for more details.

Created and maintained by [LitLifeSoftware](https://www.github.com/litlifesoftware/).

## Getting Started

To use the LitUIKit in your Flutter app make sure to import it by including the
code line `import 'package:lit_ui_kit/lit_ui_kit.dart';` in the header part of
your `.dart` file.

For help getting started with Flutter, view Flutter's
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Icons

LitUIKit does utilize its own icons (`LitIcons`). They are stored inside a `ttf` file and are implemented as Dart `IconData` objects.

## Example app

To get a better understanding for implementing LitUIKit's widgets we recommend
to take a look at the example app provided in the `example` folder. Feel free to
experiment with the UI.
